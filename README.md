# 🚩 Challenge 0: 🛠️ Build a Vault

This challenge will help you understand the fundamentals of the ERC-4626 Tokenized Vault Standard.

To complete this challenge you will do the following:

1. Impliment the logic for the Vault.sol contract
2. Deploy the vault contract on local anvil network
3. Write foundry script to mint and deposit tokens into vault
4. Write tests in foundry to get feet wet?
5. Play with frontend to visualize vault mechanics

A vault is a smart contract that accepts deposits of an underlying asset, usually an ERC-20 token. Once assets have been deposited, a vault "strategist" attempts to generate yield by executing various DeFi strategies like lending, borrowing, liquidity provision, and arbitrage.

proportional to the deposit. When a user withdraws from the vault, their "shares" are burned and their ERC-20 tokens are returned plus or minus the profit or loss generated by the strategies executed while the user held shares of the vault. Smart Contract Programmer does a great job of explaining the vault math for how many shares are minted or burned upon deposit or withdrawal.

NOTICE: The frontend will be ready to go but dont instruct them to spin up chain and deploy until checkpoint 5?

## Checkpoint 0: 📦 Environment 📚

## Checkpoint 1: Deposit

When a user deposits an ERC-20 token like wETH into a vault, the smart contract mints "shares" to the depositor

## Checkpoint 2: Withdraw

## Checkpoint 3: Foundry Scripting

- Have user write the deploy script
- Have use deploy and play with the frontend

## Checkpoint 4: Foundry Testing

- Have user write some test scripts
